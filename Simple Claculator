Output :

(1)
Enter a 1st no. : 4
Enter a 2nd no. : 5
Enter character which operation have to perform ( + , - , * , / ) : +
Addition of 4 & 5 is : 9

(2)
Enter a 1st no. : 5
Enter a 2nd no. : 2
Enter character which operation have to perform ( + , - , * , / ) : -
subtraction of 5 & 2 is : 3

(3)
Enter a 1st no. : 7
Enter a 2nd no. : 3
Enter character which operation have to perform ( + , - , * , / ) : *
Multiplication of 7 & 3 is : 21

(4)
Enter a 1st no. : 8
Enter a 2nd no. : 3
Enter character which operation have to perform ( + , - , * , / ) : /
Division of 8 & 3 is : 2.66667
