The Fibonacci sequence is a series where the next term is the sum of the previous two terms. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence is 0 followed by 1.
The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

C++ Program to Display Fibonacci Series
In this article, you will learn to print fibonacci series in C++ programming (up to nth term, and up to a certain number).

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following C++ programming topics:

C++ for Loop
C++ while and do...while Loop
The Fibonacci sequence is a series where the next term is the sum of the previous two terms. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence is 0 followed by 1.

The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
Example 1: Fibonacci Series up to n number of terms
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, t1 = 0, t2 = 1, nextTerm = 0;

    cout << "Enter the number of terms: ";
    cin >> n;

    cout << "Fibonacci Series: ";

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        // Prints the first two terms.
        if(i == 1) {
            cout << t1 << ", ";
            continue;
        }
        if(i == 2) {
            cout << t2 << ", ";
            continue;
        }
        nextTerm = t1 + t2;
        t1 = t2;
        t2 = nextTerm;
        
        cout << nextTerm << ", ";
    }
    return 0;
}




Output :

Enter the number of terms: 10
Fibonacci Series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,
