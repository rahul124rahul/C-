36 INHERITANCE & it's different types with examples in C++


Inheritance in C++

- Reusibility is very important feature of OOPS
- In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to it
- Reusing classes saves time & money
- Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developing and
     debugging the same things again


WHAT IS INHERITANCE IN C++ ?

- The concept of reusability in C++ is supported using inheritance
- We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting from it
- The existing class is called as base class
- The new class which is inherited is called as the derived class
- Reusing classes saves time and money
- There are different types of inheritance
    1) Single Inheritance
    2) Multiple Inheritance
    3) Multilevel Inheritance
    4) Hierarchical Inheritance
    5) Hybrid Inheritance
