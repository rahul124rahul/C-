44    Virtual Base Class in C++          


Following is the syntax of the virtual base class :

        class A{}

        class B : virtual public A{}        // Here interchanging of virtual and public is allowed like following

        class C : public virtual A{}

        class d : public B , public C{}

In above one class A is the base class for both B & C class 
    and  class D is derived class from class B and class C      ie., class B & C are base class for the class D
