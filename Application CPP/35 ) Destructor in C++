Output :

We are inside our main function 
creating first object n1 
This is the time when constructor is called for the object number 1

Entering this block 
Creating two more objects
 
This is the time when constructor is called for the object number 2
This is the time when constructor is called for the object number 3
Exiting this block

This is the time when my destructor is called for object number 3

This is the time when my destructor is called for object number 2


Back to main
This is the time when my destructor is called for object number 1
