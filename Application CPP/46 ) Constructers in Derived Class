/* 
46   Constructers in Derived Class 

- We can use constructor in derived class in C++
- If base class constructor does not have any argument , there is no need of any constructor in derived class
- But there are one or more arguments in the base class constructor , derived class need to pass argument to the base class constructor
- If both base & derived classes have constructors , base class constructor executed first


Constructor in Multiple Inheritance
- In multiple Inheritance , base classes are constructed in order in which they appear in the class declaration  

=> In multilevel inheritance the constructor are executed in the order of inheritance 


Special Syntax:
- C++ support an special syntax for passing arguments to multiple base classes
- The constructor of the derived class receives all the arguments at once and then will pass calls to the respective base classes 
- The body is called after all the constructors are finished executing 
    Derived-constructor (arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4) : Base1-constructor(arg1,arg2) , Base2-constructor(arg3,arg4) {}
    
    
Special case of Virtual base class:
- The constructors for virtual base classes are invoked before an non-virtual base class 
- If there are multiple virtual base classes , they are invoked in the ordered declared
- Any non-virtual base class are constructed before the derived class constructor is executed first
