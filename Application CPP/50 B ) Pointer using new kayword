//  Following one is little different example of the pointer concept using new keyword
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int *arr = new int[3];
    arr[0] = 12;
    arr[1] = 21;
    arr[2] = 11;

    cout<<"The address of _ _ _ _ _ _  is "<<arr<<endl;     // I am not getting whose address is this 

    for(int i=0 ; i<3 ;i++){
        cout<<"The value of the arr["<<i<<"] is "<<arr[i]<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}


Output :

The address of _ _ _ _ _ _  is 0x1251458
The value of the arr[0] is 12
The value of the arr[1] is 21
The value of the arr[2] is 11
