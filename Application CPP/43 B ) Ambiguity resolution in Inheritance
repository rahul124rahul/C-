// Ambiguity resolution by overloading the function 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class one{
    public:
        void something(){
            cout<<"This is the something of the one class\n";
        }
};

class two{
    public:
        void something(){
            cout<<"This is the something of the two class\n";
        }
};

int main(){
    one obj;
    obj.something();
    
    // Class tow's something function will override when this class's object is created
    two obje;
    obje.something();

    cout<<endl;
    
    return 0;
}



Output : 


This is the something of the one class
This is the something of the two class
