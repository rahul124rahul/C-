Polymorphism :
- one name and multiple forms
eg. function overloading , operator overloading , virtual function

types:  1) Compile time polymorphism     it also called as early binding  or  static binding
           - compile time polymorphism in C++ achieved using: 
             1.1 function overloading 
             1.2 operator overloading

        2) Run time polymorphism       it also called as late binding
            - compile time polymorphism in C++ achieved using: 
            2.1 virtual function
